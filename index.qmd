Welcome to my page!

I am a PhD candidate in the Food Systems Economics and Policy Group (FSEP) at ETH Zürich, Switzerland.

I work at the intersection of agri-food value chains and agri-food employment, labor market, and development economics. My research focuses on the role of agri-food employment and rural labor markets in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) #3 (good health and well-being), #5 (gender equality), and (#8) decent work. My Ph.D. field project uses a case study on Nigeria's tomato value chain. In addition, I have worked on geo-mapping food price shocks to monitor food security threats at granular levels.

I hold an MSc in International Agribusiness and Rural Development Economics from Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Germany, and a BSc in agricultural economics from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria.

**Research fields:** Agri-food value chain; Development economics, Gender, Labor economics
