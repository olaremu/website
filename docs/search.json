My research focuses on the role of agri-food employment and rural labor markets in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) #3 (good health and well-being), #5 (gender equality), and (#8) decent work. My Ph.D. field project uses a case study on Nigeria’s tomato value chain. In addition, I have worked on geo-mapping food price shocks to monitor food security threats at granular levels.\nI hold an MSc in International Agribusiness and Rural Development Economics from Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Germany, and a BSc in agricultural economics from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria.\nResearch fields: Agri-food value chain; Development economics, Gender, Labor economics"
